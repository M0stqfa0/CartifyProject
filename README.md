ðŸ›’ Cartify â€“ Local Shopping System

Cartify is a desktop shopping app built with Python + CustomTkinter.
It demonstrates a multi-page GUI (Login, Register, Home, Cart, Profile, Admin Home) and a basic in-memory shopping flow: browse products, search, sort, add/remove from cart, and navigate between pages.

Features

Authentication pages: Login & Register UI (front-end validation hooks ready).

Home (Products) page: search, category filter, sort (name / price), scrollable product cards, add/remove quantities.

Cart & Profile navigation: passes selected items to the Cart page and supports viewing the Profile page.

Responsive layout: frames center content and stretch horizontally when the window is resized.

Local data: product data stored in products.json (easy to edit / extend).

Custom, reusable widgets: EntryWidget and ComboboxWidget in utils.py to keep UI code consistent.
